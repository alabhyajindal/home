I'm a software engineer.

I enjoy learning things I am curious about, both technical and non-technical, listening to music and drinking coffee.

Some of my favorite movies:

- The Witch
- La La Land
- Ex Machina
- Mulholland Drive

Few of my favorite songs:

- Strobe by deadmau5
- Black & Chinese by Huncho Jack
- Tightrope by ZAYN
- Here by Sasha Alex Sloan

I love memes I love memes!!!!
