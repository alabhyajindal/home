title: Don't fly solo with Express

I have been working on a web app for the past month or so. It's a travel logger, where you can enter the places you have been to, and the app visualizes them on a globe.

I was no longer enjoying working on the project and decided to stop working yesterday. And I think it majorly because I chose the wrong framework for the project - [Express](https://expressjs.com/).

The app's idea was straightforward - people would register, log in, choose a username and then add a list of places they have visited in chronological order. The app would visualize them on a globe, connected by lines to indicate the travel.

### Implementation details and struggles

I first used a Postgres database hosted on [Supabase](https://supabase.com/). [Mapbox](https://www.mapbox.com/), the service I was using for geographical data visualization, stores its data in [GeoJSON](https://geojson.org/). I used the [JSONB](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/datatype-json.html) data type to store this information.

I was working to add auth at this time using [Google Identity](https://developers.google.com/identity/gsi/web/guides/overview). Getting this to work was not enjoyable because I didn't find good documentation. After struggling for a few days, I decided to go ahead and implement a simple auth system myself.

I found an amazing [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8Yxff6L_po) by [Randall Degges](https://www.rdegges.com/) which helped me a lot. I switched out the database from Postgres to MongoDB to follow the guide easily.

### Express Sound Effect #2

I completed the actual travel logging part of the app in 2 days. But I couldn't even complete the auth and database in 2 weeks. I spent a lot of time making lots of small decisions. I don't think I'll use Express for my personal projects going forward.

I don't have any conclusion. All I know is I'm not using Express or any other unopinionated framework when working solo.
