### tldr

Launched a blind dating app which didn't take off. Learning Rails and writing Python made me appreciate the frontend ecosystem a lot more.

### Launch

I launched a blind dating app on Reddit. Turns out people don't want to go blind dates - especially girls. But I got great feedback on my [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/bangalore/comments/122jo48/blind_saturday_a_blind_dating_app/) so I'm super happy.

I keep making the same mistake of launching something without figuring out if the product even solves a problem or not. I flat out assumed that people want to go on blind dates and didn't even validate this assumption before building the app.

When I first got the idea, I thought that this is going to be the next big thing and thought I should make this in Rails after reading it's [praises](https://world.hey.com/dhh/the-one-person-framework-711e6318).

I didn't know Rails so I started learning it.

### Thoughts on Ruby on Rails

- Ruby syntax is beautiful
- Rails does too much magic to get started
- Implementing authentication in Rails is trivial
- Deploying a Rails app sucks
- Fly.io is terrible

I got frustrated with the Rails experience and began building the app using tools I already knew: Supabase and Next.js. I was able to get all the basic functionality working within 2 hours.

### I love MDN

I am so happy with the current JavaScript ecosystem. The fact that anyone can build out an idea they have for free, in a matter of hours is something to be grateful for. Really, the quality of tools in the frontend space is top-notch.

I have been writing Python at work for the past 2 weeks. It has made me appreciate MDN so much. MDN contributors deserve a ton of credit for providing such a wonderful resource for developers.

This was the second marketplace app that I made, the first one being [Visits](https://alabhyajindal.com/visits/). I don't know what my next project will be, but it won't be a marketplace app.
