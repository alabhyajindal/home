title: Are you a Software Engineer or a Framework Implementor?

A Framework Implementor is a person who relies excessively on a framework for their projects. It’s working with a framework day in day out, restricted by the APIs and features exposed by the framework. They have a high-resistance to alternative methods of achieving the same goal and are generally dismissive of them.

A good test to find out if you’re one is to try and do a “simple” task without your framework. eg. create a server in Node.js without Express, create a server-rendered website without using Next.js.

I have a problem with frameworks in general. Once you get used to a framework and the set of APIs provided by it, without understanding how it actually works under the hood - you have a hard time doing anything useful without using the framework.

Frameworks abstract away too many details, making things seem magical in the process. This magic is what’s hurtful once you venture out of the framework. You realise that you don’t feel as “productive”. So you then switch back to using the framework every time. When the ideal solution would have been to begin distancing yourself from the framework and learn more fundamental topics.

People talk about improving as a software engineer and then continue to make the same kind of web applications using the framework they are comfortable in.

If you really want to improve as an engineer then go do some crazy shit. Something which is outside what you do at your job. I use React at my job. If I want to improve my technical abilities I won’t go about creating another React application in my spare time. That’s done.

I ask myself these two questions when deciding on new technologies to learn:

- Can I create something new using this which I can’t already with my existing knowledge?
- Does this technology introduce a new way of thinking for something I already do?

If the answer to either of those questions is yes then I would go about learning that thing.

Don’t keep reading your framework documentation in hopes of improving your skills. Skip the framework. Do something different.
